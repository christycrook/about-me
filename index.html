        <ul>
            <li>I was born and raised in Houston, Texas.</li> 
            <li>I am 25 years old.</li> 
            <li>I come from a huge family. I have four older brothers, an older sister, and a younger sister. I have one brother-in-law and two sister-in-laws, three neices and one nephew.</li> 
            <li>I am a huge Houston Astros fan.</li>
            <li>I love coffee and need it to function.</li>
            <li>I love to rock climb and go hiking when I can.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I started working at my home church as a Student Minstry intern right out of high school. After working there for 5 years, I transitioned to being a nanny to a little boy who just turned one. Now I am trying something completely new to me.</p>
        <p>I once made a bet with my brother-in-law, that if I were to run a marathon then he and my sister would take me to Spain. The race turned to a half-marathan, he dropped out, my sister and I ran it, and I made it to Spain. I fell in love with the country and hope that one day I can return and hopefully explore more of Europe.</p>
